# üêÑ EKG üêà

EKG is a reitaned UI-toolkit/UI library to create fancy high-perfmance GUIs. Always looking for low-specs hardware.

The EKG rendering engine implements multi-API(s) (OpenGL, OpenGL ES3, Vulkan, etc) support, and OS platform support (Android, Windows and Linux),  
EKG does not require implement on a SDL application, instead you can implement on any supported platform (SDL, GLFW, Win32, Wayland, etc).  
Because of interface oriented concepts. The graphics engine is implemented over a RHI-like (Rendering Hardware-Interface-like), and the OS platform also is an interface.

EKG implements some object-state based concepts, like in the initialization process and sampler creation, due the Khronos API high-performance Vulkan support.

The [official documentation](https://vokegpu.github.io/ekg-docs/) is not done yet.

# Get Started üêà‚Äç‚¨õ

For first, EKG does not need be implement only on SDL application, but there is only one OS platform implemented: SDL2.  
You are able to integrate GLFW, Win32, Wayland, or any window layer library, [contributing here](/include/os).

The EKG supports natively two APIs: OpenGL, and ~~Vulkan~~. Vulkan is not supported yet, but soon.  
You are able to integrate Metal or DirectX 11 and DirectX 12, [contributing here](/include/os).

Bassically, this way is deprecated but is usable. Soon EKG must implement a second native library code to separate GPU APIs implementations.  
Instead of compiling everything and linking all required libs (Vulkan and OpenGL).

Be sure you compile together all these three libs:  
[GLEW](https://glew.sourceforge.net/)/[Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/)/GLES3, [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/), and [Freetype](https://freetype.org/).

The order of the linker is important too, be sure you link EKG before the required libs.
[If you are on Android NDK](https://github.com/vokegpu/pompom), please replace GLEW with GLES3.

```
# cmake example
add_executable(your-project-name ekg SDL2main SDL2 freetype glew32)

# makefile example
cxx ... -lekg -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lfreetype -lglew32
```

C++ compiler(s) support: GCC, MinGW, Clang  
C++ std version: 17
  
Library output path:   
`lib/win32/libekg.a` Windows x86_x64  
`lib/linux/libekg.a` Linux x86_x64  
`ANDROID_ABI/libekg.a` Android armeabi-v7a arm64-v8a x86 x86_64  

Initializing EKG for SDL and OpenGL is simple.

```cpp
#include <ekg/ekg.hpp>
#include <ekg/os/ekg_opengl.hpp>
#include <ekg/os/ekg_sdl.hpp>

int32_t main(int32_t, char**) {
  // initialize SDL window
  // initialize OpenGL context and GLEW

  /**
   * Runtime property is object-state based,
   * because of Vulkan support, but it does not require a large configutarion template.
   * 
   * The font rendering requires some explains:
   * - EKG font rendering is "maximum" optimized to fast rendering, so Kanjis or any char
   * far from 256 unicode value does not have a decent implementation.
   * - Only Emojis chars are implemented on font rendering.
   * 
   * Soon EKG should add Kanji and some chars support, but for now, only emoji and text is ok.
   * You can read more about how EKG font rendering works here: <yet no link> 
   **/
  ekg::runtime_property ekg_runtime_property {
    .p_font_path = "./local_font.ttf.otf",
    .p_font_path_emoji = "./local_optional_emoji_support.ttf.otf",
    .p_gpu_api = new ekg::os::opengl(), // check documentation for Vulkan initialization (not done yet :c)
    .p_os_platform = new ekg::os::sdl(p_sdl_win)
  };

  ekg::runtime ekg_runtime {};
  ekg::init(&ekg_runtime, ekg_runtime_property);

  // now EKG is initialized and done to be used.

  while (running_loop) {
    while (SDL_PollEvent(&sdl_event)) {
      /**
       * The EKG for SDL is different from other(s) platform implementations.
       * Each platform may perform with some "overheads", as in the case of GLFW.
       * GLFW does not have a loop-statement place like SDL to poll events.
       **/
      ekg::os::sdl_poll_event(&sdl_event);
    }

    /**
     * Note: These next functions are aside from platform interface implementation,
     * only events poll is necessary an interface.
     **/

    // The delta time (framerate interval time between new and old frame loop).
    ekg::ui::dt = 0.016f; // you need to calculate by yourself.

    /**
     * You are able to add multi-thread support to EKG
     * invoking this function on a different thread.
     * But I do not recommend it.
     **/
    ekg::update();

    // Now on rendering loop section you must invoke EKG render function.
    ekg::render();
  }
}
```

# UI Elements Creation and Configuration

The EKG is not an immediate UI library, then you need to build once widgets and tasks,  
you can create widgets on the application initialization or any other place at once.

Building widgets support builder-concept, so you have free to customize a lot the widget. 

```cpp

ekg::frame("meow", ekg::vec2(200, 200), ekg::vec2(200, 200))
  ->set_drag(ekg::dock::top)
  ->set_resize(ekg::dock::left | ekg::dock::bottom | ekg::dock::right);

ekg::label("ekg sampler gui?", ekg::dock::fill);
ekg::button("click here bu", ekg::dock::fill | ekg::dock::next);

ekg::textbox("meow", "üêÑ EKG üêà", ekg::dock::fill | ekg::dock::next)
  ->set_scaled_height(3);

ekg::label("meow", ekg::dock::next);
ekg::slider("dragging the life", 0.0f, 0.0f, 666.0f, ekg::dock::fill)
  ->set_text_align(ekg::dock::center);

ekg::checkbox("checkbox like a üêà‚Äç‚¨õ", true, ekg::dock::fill | ekg::dock::next);
ekg::scrollbar("scrollbar omg");

// not necessary unless you create a second frame that you does not want to dockenize on it.
ekg::pop_group(); 
```

# Action Inputs and Tasks

The EKG is task-event-based then any widget-activity (activity here means activating the purpose of a widget, like  
a button press or a slider bar etc). You can link tasks to these activities using self-built methods on widget.

```cpp
ekg::button("inputs example meow", ekg::dock::fill)
  ->set_task(
    new ekg::task {
      .info = {
        .tag = "inputs example meow"
      },
      .function = [](ekg::info &info) {
        std::cout << info.tag << std::endl;
      }
    },
    ekg::action::activity
  );
```

This example print outputs the name of task on terminal.
