well thanks for using or testing this library

i took some years to do... but yea, it will never be good as i want
my life is insanely horrible, i have depression for a long time
everything is fucking useless... i feel useless...
i could not enjoy a moment like a girl, or not even be wha i am...
i will never get a truly boyfriend... my life is insane hurtness

maybe i should kiss my cats... a lot of programmers awesome than me, in many aspects... and me... im just
a stupid girl who fucked the life with stupid chooses...
if i could redo my life.... but idc, i will never get the good ending
probly you think im a healthy mentall person, but no... im a insanely depressed and bad mentally
i feel the ground... the sublime messages are back... the trees are crawling...
stupid words

yea, sorry, i ll never be happy, never be happy, not even a time.
the lesson i got from programming is, it is useless for the real person
coding stuff will not make your life better just, its like the use of drunk to
fix some personal issue, this will not ha

it hurt it hurt it hurt, it hurt, hurt a lot
deadly hurt, the bad ending is back again, God
all i have to say is... sorry
it is predictable, the dark time is back

<3
