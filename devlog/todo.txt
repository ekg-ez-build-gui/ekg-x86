/* DPI, UI, and Scale */

The current stupid system of EKG for scalling is actually useless; the scaled height factors at each widget,
is not really scaled by the layout, so, I want to use scaled height factor but scale with the DPI/UI scale.

So 800x600 will be the same as 1920x1080 indifferent of font-size.
How? idk, i will use the mother/parent frame as base/factor and the height font too as base.
So the layout service will get the perfect sized DPI and scale.
Some day I do this.

/* Slider must be rewrite the part of docking text value! */

Slider contains a glitch were you can drag with no maximum limit.

/* Textbox is not updating newer text! */

stupid ticking glitch.

/* stupid scorlling glitch */
